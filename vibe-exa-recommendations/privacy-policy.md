# Privacy Policy for Vibe Extension

**Last Updated: 2024-04-07**

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the Vibe browser extension ("we," "our," or "Extension") handles information when you use our service. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.

## Information We Process

### What We Access
- **Current URL**: The Extension accesses the URL of the webpage you are currently viewing.
- **Domain Lists**: The Extension stores any custom domain lists you create to filter recommendations.
- **User Preferences**: We store your settings and preferences for the Extension functionality.

### What We Do Not Collect
- We do not collect or store your browsing history.
- We do not collect or store the content of webpages you visit.
- We do not maintain any user profiles or identifiable information about you.

## How We Use Information

The current URL is used solely to:
1. Send to the Exa API to generate relevant website recommendations
2. Apply any domain filtering preferences you've set

All URL processing occurs in real-time and is not stored by us beyond the current browsing session.

## Third-Party Services

### Exa API
We use the Exa API to generate website recommendations. When you visit a webpage with our Extension active:
- The current URL is sent to Exa's servers
- Exa returns relevant website recommendations
- This transaction is governed by [Exa's Privacy Policy](https://exa.ai/privacy)

We do not share any other information with Exa beyond what is necessary to provide recommendations.

## Data Storage

### Local Storage
- Your preferences and domain lists are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API
- This information never leaves your device, except as described above
- You can clear this data at any time by resetting the Extension or clearing your browser data

## Your Choices and Controls

You can:
- Disable the Extension at any time through the Extensions menu
- Create and manage domain lists to control what recommendations you receive
- Toggle the "Same Domain Only" feature to limit recommendations to the current website

## Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Chrome Web Store page for our Extension.
